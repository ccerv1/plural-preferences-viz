# Plural Preference (ðŸ¤–,ðŸ’š)

Make a pretty polar graph of a Gitcoin user's
funding preferences during GR15.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo.
2. Confirm you have the required libraries (nothing fancy). 

## Run the script in command line

- Basic run: `python funding_graph.py ccerv1`
- With an updated max number of tags: `python funding_graph.py ccerv1 11` [looks best with 9-12]

## Note

More robust versions are possible, eg, using dollarized contribution amounts. However, this version is a basic implementation with minimal bells & whistles and error handling. 

Enjoy!
